# **Worm Game (AKA Snake)**

# Description
This is my implementation of the classic [Snake video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DekS8Pgb1qc). I built it using Java, AWT, and Swing. It was the [final project](https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-12/#e49) for the [University of Helsinki's object-oriented programming MOOC](http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) and results in a user- controlled worm that can eat and grow from the apples it pursues.

It utilizes concepts and structures such as inheritance, GUI, threads, enum, packages, classes, instance methods, interfaces, and Lists.

Here's a screenshot of the game. Click it for a larger version.

## Main.java
This is where the program runs from. It instantiates a new WormGame and UserInterface, makes the program thread-safe, prepares the game for updates according to user actions, and starts the game.

## Direction.java
An enum that holds directions for our worm to travel in.

## Piece.java
A class that returns the x and y coordinates of pieces that make up our worm.

## Apple.java
Builds the apple for the game.

## Worm.java
A class that creates a new worm composed of instances from the Piece class. It can also move and grow an existing worm.

## WormGame.java
A class that creates the worm game and gives it functionality.

## DrawingBoard.java
A class that draws the worm and the apple for the game.

## KeyboardListener.java
A class that handles worm movement input from the user.

## Updatable.java
University of Helsinki MOOC's distribution code that updates the game in real time.

## UserInterface.java
Creates the window and its components for the game to run in.
